    <title>What is Coconut Water?</title>

</head>

<body style="background-color:#ffffff">

    <h1>Coconut Water</h1>
    <p>Not to be confused with coconut milk.</p>
    <break>

    </break>

    <p>Coconut water (also coconut juice) is the clear liquid inside coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early
        development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development.
        As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut
        pulp.[1] The liquid inside young coconuts is often preferred to the liquid of a ripened coconut. Coconut water
        from young green coconuts is also known specifically as buko juice in Philippine English.[2] </p>

    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Fresh coconuts are typically harvested from the tree while they are green. A hole may be bored into the coconut
        to provide access to the "meat" (liquid and pulp). In young coconuts, the liquid and air may be under some
        pressure and may spray slightly when the inner husk is first penetrated. Coconuts that have fallen to the ground
        are susceptible to rot and damage from insects or other animals. </p>
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>Plain coconut water has long been a popular drink in tropical countries, where it is available fresh, canned, or
        bottled.

        Coconuts for drinking are served chilled, fresh, or packaged. They are often sold by street vendors who cut them
        open with machetes or similar implements in front of customers. Coconut water for retail can be found in
        ordinary aluminum cans, Tetra Paks, glass bottles or plastic bottles, sometimes with coconut pulp or coconut
        jelly included.

        Coconut water can be fermented to produce coconut vinegar. It is also used to make nata de coco, a jelly-like
        food. </p>
    <h2>Nutritional value</h2>

    <p>Providing 79 kilojoules (19 kilocalories) of food energy in a 100-millilitre (3+1‚ÅÑ2-US-fluid-ounce) amount,
        coconut water is 95% water and 4% carbohydrates, with protein and total fat content under 1% each (see the
        table). Coconut water contains small amounts of vitamins and dietary minerals, all under 10% of the Daily Value
        (DV). </p>

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>One potential (but apparently quite rare) health risk arising from excessive consumption of coconut water is an
        overabundance of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia), inducing acute kidney failure, heart arrhythmia, loss of
        consciousness and eventually death. This effect is exceedingly rare considering 8 fluid ounces of
        commercially available coconut water contains only 10 percent of the daily recommended dose of potassium.
        Hyperkalemia and loss of consciousness after the consumption of several liters of coconut water were reported
        only as a clinical case study in association with one individual's use of a commercial product following
        physical exertion. </p>
    <break>

    </break>
    <p>The Food and Drug Administration has identified a risk of bacterial contamination in coconut water sold as
        "raw". </p>

    <p>Anecdotal sources describe coconut water being used in southern part of India for senicide, the killing of
        elderly people, a procedure known as thalaikoothal. In this custom, the elderly person is made to drink an
        excessive amount of coconut water, eventually resulting in fever and death, the exact causes of which were not
        determined</p>

    <h2>Commercialization</h2>

    <p>Since the early 21st century, coconut water has been marketed in Western countries as a natural energy or sports
        drink having low levels of fat, carbohydrates, and calories, and significant electrolyte content. </p>

    <h2>False advertising</h2>

    <p>Marketing claims attributing health benefits to coconut water are not based on science and are disallowed by
        certain regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration which warned producers about
        misleading marketing claims that coconut water is antiviral, can lower cholesterol, can regulate blood glucose
        levels, and other false claims, as inappropriate for the product.</p>

    <p>Some companies have faced class-action lawsuits over false advertising claims that the product was
        "super-hydrating", "nutrient-packed", and "mega-electrolyte". The plaintiffs also alleged that one company, Vita
        Coco, falsely claimed that its product had "15 times the electrolytes found in sports drinks" and misrepresented
        the levels of sodium and magnesium as advertised. The company denied any wrongdoing and settled the lawsuit for
        US$10 million in April 2012.</p>

    <h2>Medical use in Cambodia</h2>

    <p>Although substituting coconut water for saline is not recommended by physicians today, it was a common practice
        during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. The Documentation Center of Cambodia cited the
        practice of allowing untrained nurses to administer green coconut water during the Pol Pot regime as a crime
        against humanity.</p>
